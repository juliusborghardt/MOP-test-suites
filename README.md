These Tests are published along "Implementation and Application of Method Combinations for ERP-System Development" and can be used to verify the compatibility of a Common Lisp Implementation with the MOP-based Method Combination System proposed by Didier Verna in https://hal.science/hal-04751233v1.

To run the tests, start your Lisp Environment of choice, then execute
